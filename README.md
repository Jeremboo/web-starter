# npm-server@1.0.0 - 11/07/2017

My web app starter kit only with NPM script with :

- [Npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)
- [Babel]()
- [Nodemon]()
- [EsLint](http://eslint.org/) and [AirBnb EsLint](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb)
- ...

## Inspiration

 - [Example node server with babel](https://github.com/babel/example-node-server)


## Commands :

- `npm install` for installing dependencies.

- `npm start` for starting the development with auto reloading.

- `npm run deploy` for build and starting the server.

#### Other commands :

- `npm run build` for having a `public`repository able to be used with node.

- `npm run server` for starting the server.


## Details :

- **Babel for using ES6.**
